@Chapter 5 (Functions in JS)
@Functions - Block of code that performs a specific task, can be invoked whenever needed
    1- Function Definition-: 
        function functionName(){
            // do some work
        }

        function functionname(param1, param2, ....){
            //do some work
        }

    2- Function Call:-
        functionName();

@Arrow Functions:- Compact way of writing a function

    const functionname = (param1, param2, ...) => {

    }

Qs1- Create a function using the "function" keyword that takes a String as an argument &
return the number of vowels in the string ?

Qs2- Create an arrow function to perform the same task.

@forEach Loop in Arrays:- 
                    arr.forEach(callBackFunction)
                    CallbackFunction : Here, it is a function to execute for each element in the Array

                    *A callback is function passed as an argument to another function.

                    arr.forEach(val) => {
                        console.log(val);
                    }

Qs- What is higher Order functions/ Methods in jS ? (Interview Questions)

Qs3 - For a given array of numbers, print the square of each value using the forEach loop.

Some More Array Methods:- 
    Map :- Creates a new array with the results of some operation.
    the value is callback returns are used to form new array

    arr.map( callbackFnx(value, index, array))

    let newArr = arr.map((val) => {
        return val*2;
    })

    Filter :- Creates a new array of element that give true for a confition/ filter.
    eg. All Even Elements

    let newArr = arr.filter((val) => {
        return val%2 === 0;`
    })

    Reduce :- performs some operations & reduces the array to a single value.
    It returns that single value.

Qs4- We are given array of marks of student. Filter out of the marks of students that scored 90.

Qs5 - Take a number n as input from user. Create an array of numbers from 1 to n.
    use the reduce method to calculate sum of all numbers in the array.
    use the reduce method to calculate product of all numbers in the array.
